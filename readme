the modules `perspective`, `svgtools`, `animate`, and `util` are used together to 
generate 2D animations of colorful spheres and curves with "hand-drawn"-looking outlines based off 
of a specification of the 3D locations of the spheres in some ``scene-space''. 

the `methane` module generates images of a methane molecule in the style described above 

`gold` is the same except it generates a square array of spheres

`pulse` generates a squiggly curve to emulate a laser pulse

the `methane`, `gold`, and `pulse` modules when run as __main__ generate sample output

see `scene1`, `scene2`, etc. for how all the libraries work together
